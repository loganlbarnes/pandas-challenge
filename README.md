UCI Data Analytics Pandas Challenge

Summary:

 - Below, you will find a summary for the entire district which contains the total number of schools, total number of students, total budget, average math score, average reading score, percent passing math, percent passing reading, and percent passing both math and reading. Passing is considered a score of 70 or better.
- Then, I break down the same data by school and add a column to identify if the school is a District or Charter school and calculate the budget per student.
- Then I show you the highest performing schools and the lowest performing schools based on overall pass rate.
- I list out the math and reading scores by grade level.
- By categorizing per student spending into 4 categories, I am able to calculate the average scores and pass rates by spending range.
- By categorizing school size (student count) into 3 categories, I am able to calculate the average scores and pass rates by school size.
- Lastly, I show you the comparison in scores by district and and charter school.

Conclusions:

- For the entire district, math scores are lower than reading scores, with the pass rate for both being 65%.
- The top 5 schools based on overall passing rate are all charter schools, while the lowest 5 schools based on overall passing rate are all district schools.
- The average overall passing rate is lower for schools that spent greater than 585 per student.
- Schools that are considered large (2000 - 5000 students) have a lower overall passing rate than those that are considered small (<1000).
